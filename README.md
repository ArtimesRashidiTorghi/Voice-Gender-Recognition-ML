# Voice-Gender-Recognition-ML
Voice-based gender recognition using machine learning to classify speakers’ gender from audio features like MFCCs, pitch, and tone. This project involves data preprocessing, model training (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks), evaluation, and deployment using Python and libraries like Librosa, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

### Project Overview

The project utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques to classify the gender of a speaker from their voice. It leverages a dataset containing audio recordings, which are preprocessed to extract relevant features. These features include audio spectral features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), pitch, tone, and other vocal characteristics that distinguish male and female voices.

### Key Components of the Project
	•	Data Preprocessing: The raw audio files are preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. Features such as MFCCs are extracted to represent the audio data in a format suitable for model training.
	•	Model Training: Several machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and neural networks, are used to train the system. These models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	•	Evaluation: The models are tested using a separate validation set to assess their performance. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to improve the models’ generalization and accuracy.
	•	Deployment: The final model is deployed using Python-based frameworks, allowing for easy integration with applications requiring gender classification based on voice input.

### Technologies Used
	•	Python: The primary programming language used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
	•	Librosa: For audio feature extraction.
	•	Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
	•	TensorFlow/PyTorch: For deep learning models (optional depending on complexity).

### Future Work and Improvements

Future work may include integrating more advanced deep learning models, improving feature extraction techniques, and applying the system to real-time voice recognition systems. This project can be extended to identify additional voice characteristics, such as age or emotional tone.
